## About Throwdown

Throwdown is designed to be a simple bare bones flat-file CMS engine that allows you to get to work. Plain and simple.


## Getting started:

You should be familiar with the following to better utilize this framework:

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](http://npmjs.org/)
- [Dispatch PHP](https://github.com/noodlehaus/dispatch)

Then add whatever you like! Template how you want, setup a MySQL or a SQLite db, hook up a Mongo instance, setup a build process.
