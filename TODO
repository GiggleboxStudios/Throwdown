Throwdown:
 ☐ Figure out how to move the Composer "vendor" directory to inside the /app directory
 ☐ Figure out if Eden.php is going to be used for anything more than it's awesome mail features and re-download a slimmed down lib for it
 ☐ Build "Page" caching mechanism so we can add Pages to navigation
 ☐ Figure out if we can do taxonomies in templates based on current "View"
